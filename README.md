## 🚀 Overview

This project implements an innovative authentication system that leverages geometric action patterns captured through accelerometer data. By analyzing user movement patterns in both time and frequency domains, the system can accurately identify and authenticate individuals based on their unique motion signatures.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔄 Dual-Input Architecture**: Processes both time-domain and frequency-domain features simultaneously
- **📊 Advanced Data Preprocessing**: Implements Global Average Pooling for feature optimization
- **🧠 Custom Neural Network**: Multi-layer architecture with sophisticated regularization
- **⚡ Real-time Classification**: Binary classification for authentic user verification
- **📈 High Accuracy**: Achieves 90% test accuracy with robust validation
- **🛡️ Regularization**: Comprehensive dropout, batch normalization, and L1/L2 regularization

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### Dual-Branch Neural Network

#### 🌊 Frequency Domain Branch (43 features)
```
Input (43) → Dense(64) → BatchNorm → Dropout → Dense(32) → Dropout
```

#### ⏰ Time Domain Branch (88 features)
```
Input (88) → Dense(64) → BatchNorm → Dropout → Dense(32) → Dropout
```

#### 🔗 Merged Architecture
```
Concatenate → Dense(64) → BatchNorm → Dropout → Dense(32) → Dropout → Dense(16) → Output(2, softmax)
```

## 📁 Data Structure

### Dataset Organization

Your dataset should follow this naming convention:

```
data/
├── U01_Acc_TimeD_FDay.csv    # User 1 Time Domain Training
├── U01_Acc_FreqD_FDay.csv    # User 1 Frequency Domain Training
├── U01_Acc_TimeD_MDay.csv    # User 1 Time Domain Testing
├── U01_Acc_FreqD_MDay.csv    # User 1 Frequency Domain Testing
├── U02_Acc_TimeD_FDay.csv    # User 2 Time Domain Training
└── ...
```

### File Naming Convention

```
U[UserID]_Acc_[TimeD/FreqD]_[FDay/MDay].csv
```

- **UserID**: Unique identifier for each user
- **TimeD/FreqD**: Time Domain or Frequency Domain features
- **FDay/MDay**: Training (FDay) or Testing (MDay) data

## 🎯 Usage

### 1. Prepare your dataset

Ensure your CSV files contain accelerometer data with proper labeling and follow the naming convention above.

### 2. Run the authentication system

```bash
# Launch Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook

# Or run the Python script directly
python train_model.py
```

The system will automatically:
- 📥 Load and preprocess data
- 🔧 Build the dual-input neural network
- 🏋️ Train the model with early stopping
- 📊 Evaluate performance metrics
- 💾 Save the trained model

### 4. Authentication

```python
# Load trained model
model = load_model('gaban_model.h5')

# Authenticate user with new accelerometer data
prediction = model.predict([freq_features, time_features])
is_authentic = prediction[0][1] > 0.5
```
